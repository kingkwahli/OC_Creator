# OpenCore EFI Creator

## OpenCore EFI and Config.plist Generation Utility (Updated)

**Current OpenCore Version: 1.0.3**  
*(This version always aligns with Lilu, WhateverGreen, and VirtualSMC versions.)*

OpenCore EFI Creator is a utility designed to generate a pre-configured `config.plist` and EFI folder for Hackintosh setups, which will be saved directly to the user's desktop. The configuration is based on system architectures outlined in Dortania's [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).

This tool is a continuation and enhancement of the original OC Gen-X, with updated kexts, drivers, and additional customization options.

## Important Information

**Please read and follow [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) before and during use** to ensure you select the correct settings for your device.

- This app currently supports only desktop Hackintosh configurations. Predefined settings for laptops are not available yet but are planned for future updates.
