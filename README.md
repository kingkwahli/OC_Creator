# OpenCore EFI Creator
## OpenCore EFI and config.plist generation utility (updated)

I took the original OC Gen-X and am now updating the Kexts and Drivers and adding more options to the app.

OC Creator is a utility application to create a pre-defined config.plist and a EFI Folder, saved to the user's desktop.

The config.plist generated is based off the architectures in dortania's OpenCore Install Guide.

### Important Information (Please read below)
This app is only for desktop Hackintoshes, it does not (currently, but coming soon) have any pre-defined settings for laptops.
